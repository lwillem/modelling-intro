# Objectives
The aim of this tutorial is to run scenario analyses with an individual-based model in R that accounts for location specific mixing.

In this session, you will

1. Run an IBM with household, school/work and community mixing.
2. Discuss the impact of transmission parameters and features

The best thing to do is to read each section and type (or copy and paste) the R commands (in grey boxes) into your own R session to check that you understand the code. <n style="color:darkred"> Hands-on questions are indicated in **red** </n>

# Modelling concepts

The individual-based model will make use of a virtual population in which each individual is part of a household, school/work (based on age), and the general community. Each day (= time step), individuals can interact at home, school/work and in the community. We specify for each location a contact probability or average number of contacts per day.

# Set working directory
The first step when creating a new R file is to specify a working directory. You need to tell the R session where you want it to work. To do this you use the command to "set the working directory" or `setwd()`. 

You can label this working directory as 'home', and have other locations stored for plotting or for getting data. This location should be an existing folder on your computer. For example

```{r results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
home <- "~/Documents/Modelling_intro/" ## on a OS X
home <- "C:\\Documents\\Modelling_intro\\" ## on windows
setwd(home)
```

# Load model code

If the `curl` package is not installed yet, you can do so by
```{r results = "hide", eval=FALSE}
install.packages(curl) # install the curl library (to import data)
```

Please load the IBM functions we prepared on the GitHub repository. Using your skills from the previous tutorial(s), you should be able to code this model yourselves.

```{r eval= FALSE}
# load package 'curl'
library('curl')

# download R file with IBM function
curl_download("https://github.com/lwillem/modelling-intro/raw/master/lib/ibm_functions.R", destfile = "ibm_functions.R")

# load the IBM functions
source('ibm_functions.R')
```

# Base case scenario

<n style="color:darkred">
First, let's run the model with the default parameters:
</n>

```{r }
# you can run the location-specific IBM with default parameters (see console)
run_ibm_location()

```

<n style="color:darkred">
What can you learn from these graphs?
</n>


```{r}

# The location-specific IBM uses the create_population_matrix(...) function to obtain a population.
# Inspect the initial lines of this function to determine the rules governing the stochastic setup of the population.
head(create_population_matrix,9)

```

<n style="color:darkred">
Can you confirm these population rules based on the graphs above?
</n>

# Explore some parameters

The "model parameters" from the model printout above can be used as function arguments to modify the default settings. For example, you can change the number of community contacts per day by adjusting `num_contacts_community_day`.

```{r eval=FALSE}

# increase the number of contacts in the community per day to 6 (= 'num_contacts_community_day')
run_ibm_location(num_contacts_community_day = 6)

# set num_schools to 5
run_ibm_location(num_school = 6)

# set transmission_prob to 0.15 (and switch off the demographic plots)
run_ibm_location(transmission_prob = 0.15,
                 bool_show_demographics = FALSE)

```


## Scenarios
<n style="color:darkred">
Now, what happens if you...

* change the population size to 100 or 2000?
* start with more infected individuals?
* add more schools
* decrease the number of workplaces
* allow only household contacts?
* allow only community contacts?
* allow only school contacts?
* allow only household and school contacts?
* allow only household and workplace contacts?
* ... etc.
</n>

(TIP: the `run_ibm_location` function has an option to `add_baseline = TRUE` to add model results with the default parameters. However, this increases the run time since the model is executed twice.)
