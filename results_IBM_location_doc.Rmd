# Load model code

Please load the IBM functions we prepared on the GitHub repository. Using your skills from the previous tutorial(s), you should be able to code this model yourselves.

If the `curl` packages is not installed yet, you can do so by:
```{r results = "hide", eval=FALSE}
install.packages(curl) # install the curl library (to import data)
```

```{r eval= FALSE}
# load package 'curl'
library('curl')

# download R file with IBM function
curl_download("https://github.com/lwillem/modelling-intro/raw/master/lib/ibm_functions.R", 
              destfile = "ibm_functions.R")

# load the IBM functions
source('ibm_functions.R')
```
